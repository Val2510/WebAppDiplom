Testing Data for the Website: To test registration and book adding functionalities, 
please use the following user: 
User: name "Fox", email Fox123@gmail.com, 
password "foxfox", city "London". 
This will enable full access to the application's functionality. 
Alternatively, you can create a new user, but it's preferable to choose 
cities from the existing ones: London, New York, Milan, as they are already present in the database.
For testing book search functionality, use the following author 
surnames and book titles: Lee, Orwell, J.R.R. Tolkien, 1984, The Hobbit. Use nested collections in MongoDB.
